# Note Taker Starter Code

 ## Description
 This note taker application was meant to further teach us how to use Express.js, as well as how to deploy applications to Heroku. We had to create the server-side code in a server.js file in order for the application to function correctly. We also had to install multiple dependencies including Express and fs, and initalize an instance of Express using the const app = express () function. I also specified the port to 3001 and installed custom middleware as well. 

 The application itself is used to write, save, and even delete notes as the user pleases in order to help organize their tasks, create notes/reminders, and many other purposes. I added in the delete functionality to hopefully meet the requirements of the bonus!

 ## Disclosures
 Outside of the starter code, I utilized a tutor, Alexis (once again, he was great!), and asked for help during office hours with my instructor. I also had help from the Xpert Learning Assistant to help write some of the server.js file code.

 Also--there are not many commits due to an error. I cloned the starter code, but never created a GitHub repo to track all of my changes until close to the end of development. That is my fault, and I accept any grade deduction that may come as a result. I treid to make the commit messages I had as descriptive as possible to give the grader as clear a picture as possible as to what each change/update was.
